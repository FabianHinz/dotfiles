Naibafos dotfiles
=================

This directory contains my collection of dotfiles as well as an install and
update script.

My setup was largely inspired by the
[zshrc0](https://github.com/ImmanuelHaffner/zsh-rc) and
[vimrc](https://github.com/ImmanuelHaffner/vimrc) of ImmanuelHaffner as well as
[caarlos0/dotfiles](https://github.com/caarlos0/dotfiles/) and
[nisaacson/dotfiles](https://github.com/nisaacson/dotfiles).

This is currently a work in progress and while some files might work as is, it
is highly unlikely.
